#### Problem 31

After obtaining 106ms,

$ DevRTT=0.75 * 5+0.25 * |106-100| =5.25ms $

$ EstimatedRTT=0.875*100+0.125 * 106 = 100.75 ms$

$ TimeoutInterval = 100.75+4*5.25 = 121.75 ms$



After obtaining 120ms,

$ DevRTT=0.75*5.25+0.25*\vert 120 – 100.75\vert =8.75ms$

$ EstimatedRTT = 0.875 * 100.75 + 0.125 * 120 = 103.16 ms$

$TimeoutInterval = 103.16+4*8.75 = 138.16 ms$



After obtaining 140ms,

$ DevRTT=0.75*8.75+0.25*\vert 140 – 103.16\vert =15.77 ms$

$EstimatedRTT = 0.875 * 103.16 + 0.125 * 140 = 107.76 ms$

$TimeoutInterval = 107.76+4*15.77 = 170.84 ms$



After obtaining 90ms,

$ DevRTT=0.75*15.77+0.25*\vert 90 – 107.76\vert =16.27 ms$

$EstimatedRTT = 0.875 * 107.76 + 0.125 * 90 = 105.54 m$

$TimeoutInterval = 105.54+4*16.27 =170.62 ms$



After obtaining 115ms,

$ DevRTT=0.75*16.27+0.25*\vert 115 – 105.54\vert =14.57 ms$

$EstimatedRTT = 0.875 * 105.54 + 0.125 * 115 = 106.72 ms$

$TimeoutInterval = 106.72+4*14.57 =165 ms$

#### Problem 51

##### a

From the table we can see that after 2200msec, the window size of C1 and C2 is   2.

##### b

Yes. They will have the same RTT.

##### c

Yes. The max window size will be 2.

##### d

No. 

The two connections act as a single connection so the connection is not fully  used. 

The solution is to add a finite buffer to the link.
