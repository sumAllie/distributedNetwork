### Problem 2

The first packet is sent at the time of $ N*(L/R) $. Since then, after each time of L/R, the next packet is sent.

In all, after the time of $ N*(L/R) + (P-1)*(L/R) $, all packets will be sent successfully.

### Problem 6

#### a

$ d_{prop} = m/s $

#### b

$ d_{trans} = L/R $

#### c

$ d_{endToEnd} =d_{prop}+d_{trans} = m/s + L/R $

#### d

At the time of $ t = d_{trans} $, the last bit of the packet is just leaving the Host A.

#### e

At the time of $ t = d_{trans} $, the last bit of the packet is in the link.

#### f

At the time of $ t = d_{trans} $, the last bit of the packet has reached the Hose B.

#### g

When $ d_{trans} = d_{prop} $, $ m/s = L/R $

$ m = s*L/R = (2.5*10^{8})*120/(56*10^{3}) = 536km $

### Problem 13

#### a

$ (L/R + 2L/R + ...+(N-1)L/R)/N $

$ = (1+(N-1))(N-1)L/2NR = (N-1)L/2R $

#### b

The average queuing delay of a packet is $ (N-1)L/2R $.
